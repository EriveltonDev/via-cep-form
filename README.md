# Welcome to my repository!

Here you'll find a simple project where I leveraged the powerful combination of clean architecture, Next.js 13, React Hook Form, and a library called Zod for form validation. Additionally, I employed the concept of composition to create highly reusable and flexible components.

## Clean Architecture

Clean architecture allows for a clear separation of responsibilities, making the code more organized and easily maintainable. 

## Next.js 13

Next.js 13, one of the latest versions of the framework, offers an enhanced development experience and performance optimizations for your web applications.

## React Hook Form

With React Hook Form, I was able to create forms in a simple and efficient manner without the need for additional libraries.

## Zod Library

The star of this project is the Zod library, which provides an elegant and powerful way to validate the data entered in our forms. With a clear and intuitive syntax, Zod simplifies validation, allowing us to focus on business logic and user experience.

## Composition Approach

The composition approach used in the project allows for the creation of modular and reusable components, making code maintenance and expansion easier and more scalable. By breaking components down into smaller parts, we were able to create flexible and adaptable interfaces that can adjust to the specific needs of each form.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
