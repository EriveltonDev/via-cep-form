# Clean Architecture and React Hook Form - Simple Address Search Project

This GitHub project is a simple application that utilizes the Via CEP API to search for addresses. It showcases the quality of the codebase by implementing the Clean Architecture principles and leveraging the React Hook Form library.

## Key Features

- **Clean Architecture**: The codebase is structured into layers, separating concerns and improving maintainability.
- **React Hook Form**: Efficient form management with built-in validation and error handling capabilities.
- **Via CEP API Integration**: Utilizes the Via CEP API to retrieve address information.
- **Modularity and Reusability**: Encourages the creation of reusable components and modules.
- **Testability**: The architecture and code structure facilitate the creation of unit tests.

## Description

The Clean Architecture approach promotes separation of concerns and maintainability by dividing the codebase into layers based on dependencies. This project demonstrates a clear separation between the presentation layer (React components) and the business logic layer (services and repositories).

In addition, the project utilizes React Hook Form, a powerful library for form management in React applications. React Hook Form simplifies form handling by leveraging React hooks, allowing for cleaner and more efficient code.

By combining the Clean Architecture principles with the usage of React Hook Form, this project emphasizes code organization, reusability, and testability. The clean and modular structure enables developers to easily extend and maintain the application.

Whether you are new to Clean Architecture or React Hook Form, this project serves as a valuable resource for learning and applying these concepts to a real-world scenario.




This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
